Data Preprocessing: Images are resized and normalized to ensure consistency during training.
CNN Architecture: The model leverages several convolutional and pooling layers to extract features, followed by fully connected layers for classification.
Model Evaluation: The performance of the trained model is assessed using accuracy metrics and a confusion matrix, providing insights into its classification capabilities.
Visualization: Training and validation accuracy/loss over epochs are plotted to visualize the model's performance
